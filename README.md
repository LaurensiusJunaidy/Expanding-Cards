# Expanding-Cards
This project involves creating interactive expanding cards that display background images and headings. The key features include:

* Styling Panels: Each card will have a background image and a heading, which will be aligned using flexbox.
* JavaScript Interaction: When a card is clicked, it dynamically receives an active class, triggering an expansion effect.
* CSS Transitions: Smooth animations will control the card expansion, with headings appearing only after the card is fully expanded.
* Flexibility: While the demo uses images and headings, the design can be adapted for other uses like testimonials, FAQs, or image galleries.
